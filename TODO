= To do

* Fix the scaffold to successfully create singleton resources too.

* Create a layout generator which creates a sensible default layout using YUI
  grids.

* Convert into a gem.

* Figure out how to do automated testing of generators.

* Figure a way to keep track of changes to the Rails (and RSpec) generators
  used as inspiration so we can merge in changes.
